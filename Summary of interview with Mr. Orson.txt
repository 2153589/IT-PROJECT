The owner, Mr. Edmundo Bautista, is the CEO of the business.
There is also a bookeeper who keeps and handles all the papers, logbooks and documents for transactions.
Mr. Orson is the current manager, na mapapalitan na ni Mr. Jomar. The CEO and bookkeeper have the closest relationship.
The bookkeeper is considered an aly in the business. The manager check all accounts, inventories, man power and implementation of COC. 
Then we have the Executive chef, the sous chef, and cooks. Next is the captain or supervisor na under ni Manager.
The captain has a team leader, or can also be the leader. The attendants/waiters na may shifting schedule depende sa sahuran.
Si purchaser siya yung nakatoka sa purchasing. Si Cashier naman, siya yung nagtatally ng mga data, sales, petty cash, employees meal (everyday)
ano yung mga nabenta sino yung kumuha ng cash, ganon. Utility man is under ni captain pero hawak rin ni manager.


4. Please describe us the basic business operation for the following,

    (Operation hours of the restaurant is from 6 am until 1 am.)

   * CUSTOMER ORDERING PROCESS
    - Attendants would give the customers a menu.
      Afterwards, waiters would go to the customers to take their orders using a pen and a paper.

   * PAYMENT PROCESS
     - The attendant would go to the customer and gives the bill. The customer can pay using checks, cash, and debit/card.
     - Yung payment is sa Sales Report (tinatally)
     - nirerecord by OS (lahat ng order may OS, may pera, may nakalagay na amount.)
     - hiwalay yung sa food and beverage (kasi magkaibang sales yan)
     - manual yung pagrerecord ng payment, nilalagay sa logbook, kaha(?),
     - yung OS may pangalan ng waiter na nakalagay don na nagserve ng order.
     - all receipts are kept for documentation/filing (stored in a vault, chinecheck itong mga resibong ito ng BIR)

     (kung pumunta yung bookkeeper don ichecheck at ieedit niya yung lahat ng resibo na nasa documentation/filing kung magkano
     lahat ng kinikita ng restaurant kung ilang buwan, taon. Si bookkeeper na yung naggagather at nagaayos ng mga papers na gagamitin din niya
     pag may transaction sa city hall, yung sa tax. (kasama siya sa accounting) nirereport niya yung mga details sa owner)

   * RESERVATION PROCESS
     - The customer can call or simply go there personally to make a reservation. The customer can talk to
       any of the staff inside the restaurant. The customer will state its name, contact details, the occassion
       for which the reservation is made, and can also order in advance. The customer is required to pay 50% in advance to secure the reservation.

5. How do you acquire products/goods and where do you get them?

     - goods are stored in a stockroom (2 stockroom: for dry and wet goods)
     - The purchaser is in charge of purchasing.

     - There are two ways for the business to get its products/goods. First a purchaser would go to a specific market personally
       to get what the business lack/needs. Second, the supplier will send the products that was ordered by the purchaser and will be 
       delivered to the restaurant. The mode of payment is cash on delivery. (Bihira lang tho na yung mga products
       ay idedeliver, nakadepende rin kasi sa company na pinagorderan ng supplies.)

     - The purchaser is in charge of the stock standard, chinecheck niya yung mga paubos na goods. Chinecheck niya yung mga stock,
       ingredients sa kitchen and bar. The purchaser handle its own time.
       (Par Stock System yung inventory niya and nirereport niya yun sa manager every meeting nila ng first week of the month)
       irereport niya yung mga fast-moving at yung slow-moving, expiry ng mga goods, kunwari, itong can goods na to 
       3 days na lang mageexpire na so kailangan mareplensih ito...yung mga coke malapit ng magexpire
       pwede nating ibenta ng mas mababa or ibalik sa company.

     - 50/50 rule... imomonitor ni purchaser yung mga stock (kapag yung yung isang product na may quantity of 10 tapos
       5 na lang yung natira, hindi na niya hihintaying maubos yung product na yon, oorder or bibili na kaagad siya.)

* There is also a PURCHASER and MARKETING relationship sa restaurant.

 - The marketing have its own stock, own menu, and is also the budgeter. 
   They offer group packages for special ocassions like birthdays, etc...

 - oofferan niya si purchaser/customer ng mga ganitong packages with discounts na (example yung ganitong deal 500 yung original price magiging 300 na lang)...

 - categorize in banquet (event banquets)


6. Can you describe us the inventory process in your business?

  * Ano po yung mga iniinventory niyo? 
   - food and beverages, as well as gamit na categorized in two, gamit sa kitchen and gamit sa dining.
     (inventory for dining consists upuan, kubyertos, plato whereas in the kitchen ay yung mga kutsilyo, 
     frying pan, lahat ng kitchen utensils utensils)

  * who manages/ is assigned in taking inventory of goods and stock? 
   - manager, purchaser, cashier, employees.

  * how frequent do you buy stocks?

  - par stocking system in the inventory is the categorizing of stocks that are already in the 50/50 state. 
    (Pwedeng may involvement ang Purchaser dito BUT yung main officer na nagmamanage neto is yung 
    INVENTORY CLERK na naghahandle ng stockroom. Pero, si purchaser at inventory clerk sa business nila ay iisa...)
    (kunwari may staff/chef na kukuha ng ganitong product sa stockroom sasabihin sa kanya,
    "kuha ka na lang don, ilista mo na lang..." (kaya alam agad ni purchaser/inventory clerk yung matitira/nangyayari sa stock niya))

  - everyday sila nagiinventory. May sequence or dalawang klase ng inventory may written atsaka actual.
    "yung written inventory usually daily yan para consistent yung papeles mo. May beginning ending, beginning ending..." 
    "yung actual inventory, monthly yan. Lahat ng nagather mo na mga papeles titignan yan isa isa kung tama talaga, imamatch
     yan."
   
  - kapag nagiinventory kasi may nakalagay na pangalan kung sino naginventory non. Ngayon pag di nag match, siya yung tatamaan
    (yeah, "tatamaan" talaga yung term ni Sir Orson kapag nagkamali yung kung sino nagtake ng inventory non hahahahah)

  - may shifting sa inventory nila everyday (iba iba talaga yung nakatoka sa pagiinventory)
  
  - Yung pagaassign naman ng pagtatake ng inventory, kapag kailangan talaga magaasign, para sa mga head lang (head sa dining, head sa kitchen). 
    Yung sinasabi ni Sir na everyday na pagiinventory (kahit sino sa mga staff/employees)

  * what do you use to list or take your inventory?
    - We use logbooks and excel spreadsheets.

  * si executive chef ng kitchen tapos si captain ng dining, nagrereport sila ng mga nainventory nila kay manager.
  - si manager naman nagche check and balance. Afterwards magrereport kay owner.

  - They use sales statement and have their own format for this statement.

7. What device do you use in the restaurant rtansaction? specially for the inventory?

   - Desktop computers.

   * Who can access this device and inventories?
    - manager, cashier, owner. 
     (some staff take inventories but when it comes to the full access and pagmamanage ay para lang sa manager, cashier and owner.)


8. Were there any problems encountered by your restaurant so far? 

  (labas at loob)

  - guest relation
  - tao, operation 
  - (man power, lack of communication, and budget, miscount)
  - problems in inventory (miscount, expiry, pilferage, spoilage)
  - loss of profit because of mismanagement
